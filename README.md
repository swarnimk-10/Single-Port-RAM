# Single-Port-RAM

A single-port RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of memory architecture where there is only one access point (port) to the memory array, meaning both read and write operations use the same port. This design restricts simultaneous access, so the memory can either be read from or written to in any given clock cycle, but not both at the same time.

The design looks like this:
